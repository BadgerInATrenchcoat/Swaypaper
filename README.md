# Swaypaper
A small Python project for cycling through all available wallpapers in a given folder when using the Sway window manager. Currently it swaps to the next available wallpaper every five minutes. Soon this will be adjustable.

## Valid usage
Swaypaper can be run by using:
```python3 swaypaper.py [start/stop]``` 
And directories can be provided in "/path/to/directory/" format.
